  "biography": "A statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Forsaken, was venerated in Valencia, Spain, since the 15th century. In 1936, the Missionaries of Gujarat desired to build at Khambhokaj a shrine to Our Lady, under the consoling title: Mother of the Forsaken. A sculptor in Valencia, Innocencio Cuesta Lopez made a statue of Mother of the Forsaken in 1951. Later this statue was brought to India. This beautiful statue, motherly image of our heavenly Mother, has been erected in the shrine of Baroda and the devotion to Mother of the Forsaken has become very popular.\n\nMary, Mother of the Forsaken: Pray for us!\n\nThe Feast day is celebrated on 26th January._\n\nTimothy was Paul's dearest disciple, his most steadfast associate. He was converted during the apostle's first missionary journey. When Paul revisited Lystra, Timothy, though still very young (about twenty) joined him as a co-worker and companion.\n\nThereafter, there existed between them a most intimate bond, as between father and son. St. Paul calls him his beloved child, devoted to him \"like a son to his father\" (Phil. 2:22). Of a kindly disposition, unselfish, prudent, zealous, he was a great consolation to Paul, particularly in the sufferings of his later years. He also assisted the apostle in the establishment of all the major Christian communities and was entrusted with missions of highest importance.\n\nTimothy was with Paul during his first Roman imprisonment. Paul made his self-sacrificing companion bishop of Ephesus, but the finest monument left him by his master are the two canonical Epistles bearing his name.\n\n— Excerpted from The Church's Year of Grace, Pius Parsch\n\nSt. Titus, a pagan by birth, became one of St. Paul's most illustrious disciples. He accompanied the apostle on several of his missionary journeys and was entrusted with important missions.\n\nFinally he came with St. Paul to the island of Crete, where he was appointed bishop. He performed this duty in accordance with the admonition given him, \". . . in all things show yourself an example of good works\" (Tit. 2:7).\n\nTradition tells us that he died a natural death at the age of 94, having lived in the state of virginity during his whole life. St. Paul left a worthy monument to Titus, his faithful disciple, in the beautiful pastoral letter which forms part of the New Testament. Today's feast in his honor was introduced in 1854.\n\n— Excerpted from The Church's Year of Grace, Pius Parsch",

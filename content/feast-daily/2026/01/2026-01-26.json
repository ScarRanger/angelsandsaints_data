  "summary": "A statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Forsaken, was venerated in Valencia, Spain, since the 15th century. In 1936, the Missionaries of Gujarat desired to build at Khambhokaj a shrine to Our Lady, under the consoling title: Mother of the Forsaken. A sculptor in Valencia, Innocencio Cuesta Lopez made a statue of Mother of the Forsaken in 1951. Later this statue was brought to India. This beautiful statue, motherly image of our heavenly Mother, has been erected in the shrine of Baroda and the devotion to Mother of the Forsaken has become very popular.",

        "1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:",
        "2 Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.",
        "3 And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.",
        "4 And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.",
        "5 No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.",
        "6 And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood. and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: I have said to thee: Live in thy blood.",
        "7 I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman’s ornament: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou wast naked, and full of confusion.",
        "8 And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers: and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. And I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God: and thou becamest mine.",
        "9 And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil.",
        "10 And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shod thee with violet coloured shoes: and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.",
        "11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck.",
        "12 And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.",
        "13 And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours: thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen.",
        "14 And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.",
        "15 But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his.",
        "60 And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth: and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.",
        "63 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.",
        "Or",
        "59 For thus saith the Lord God: I will deal with thee, as thou hast despised the oath, in breaking the covenant:",
        "60 And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth: and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.",
        "61 And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed: when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.",
        "62 And I will establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,",
        "63 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God."

        "5 For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh.",
        "6 Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.",
        "7 They say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away?",
        "8 He saith to them: Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.",
        "9 And I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.",
        "10 His disciples say unto him: If the case of a man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to marry.",
        "11 Who said to them: All men take not this word, but they to whom it is given.",
        "12 For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, who were made so by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. He that can take, let him take it."

        "3 And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come.",
        "4 Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my calves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage.",
        "5 But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise.",
        "6 And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.",
        "7 But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.",
        "8 Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.",
        "9 Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.",
        "10 And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.",
        "11 And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.",
        "12 And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent.",
        "13 Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
        "14 For many are called, but few are chosen."

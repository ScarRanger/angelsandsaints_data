        "17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.",
        "18 For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.",
        "19 For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.",
        "20 Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
        "21 For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.",
        "22 For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:",
        "23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:",
        "24 But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.",
        "25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."

        "5 Thus saith the Lord: Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.",

        "7 Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lord, and the Lord shall be his confidence.",
        "8 And he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots towards moisture: and it shall not fear when the heat cometh. And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be solicitous, neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit.",
        "9 The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable, who can know it?",
        "10 I am the Lord who search the heart and prove the reins: who give to every one according to his way, and according to the fruit of his devices."

        "21 Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.",
        "22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.",
        "23 And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:",
        "24 And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.",
        "25 And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.",
        "26 And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.",
        "27 And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father’s house, for I have five brethren,",
        "28 That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.",

        "31 And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead."

        "20 But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.",
        "21 And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.",

        "64 Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.",
        "65 Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:",
        "66 What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.",
        "67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,",
        "68 Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?",

        "73 And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.",
        "74 Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.",
        "75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.",
        "27:1 And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.",

        "4 Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.",
        "5 And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.",
        "6 But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.",
        "7 And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter’s field, to be a burying place for strangers.",
        "8 For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.",

        "18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.",
        "19 And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.",
        "20 But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.",
        "21 And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.",
        "22 Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.",
        "23 The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.",
        "24 And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.",
        "25 And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.",
        "26 Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.",

        "41 In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:",
        "42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.",
        "43 He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.",
        "44 And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.",

        "64 Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.",
        "65 Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.",
        "66 And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.",

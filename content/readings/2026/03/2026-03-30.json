        "4 Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:",
        "5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?",
        "6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.",
        "7 Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.",
        "8 For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.",

        "10 But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:",
        "11 Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus."

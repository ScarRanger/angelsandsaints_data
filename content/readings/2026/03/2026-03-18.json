        "20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.",
        "21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.",
        "22 For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.",
        "23 That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.",

        "30 I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me."

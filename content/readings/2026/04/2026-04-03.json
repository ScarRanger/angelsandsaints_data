        "8 He was taken away from distress, and from judgment: who shall declare his generation? because he is cut off out of the land of the living: for the wickedness of my people have I struck him.",
        "9 And he shall give the ungodly for his burial, and the rich for his death: because he hath done no iniquity, neither was there deceit in his mouth.",

        "12 Therefore will I distribute to him very many, and he shall divide the spoils of the strong, because he hath delivered his soul unto death, and was reputed with the wicked: and he hath borne the sins of many, and hath prayed for the transgressors."

        "3 Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.",
        "4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom seek ye?",
        "5 They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.",
        "6 As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward, and fell to the ground.",
        "7 Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.",

        "11 Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?",
        "12 Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him:",
        "13 And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.",
        "14 Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for the people.",
        "15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.",
        "16 But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.",
        "17 The maid therefore that was portress, saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith: I am not.",
        "18 Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter also, standing, and warming himself.",
        "19 The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.",
        "20 Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.",
        "21 Why asketh thou me? ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them: behold they know what things I have said.",
        "22 And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so?",
        "23 Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?",
        "24 And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.",

        "28 Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor’s hall. And it was morning; and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.",
        "29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this man?",
        "30 They answered, and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.",
        "31 Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death;",

        "33 Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?",
        "34 Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?",
        "35 Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?",
        "36 Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.",
        "37 Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.",
        "38 Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no cause in him.",
        "39 But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?",

        "3 And they came to him, and said: Hail, king of the Jews; and they gave him blows.",
        "4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.",
        "5 (Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.",
        "6 When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.",
        "7 The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.",
        "8 When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.",
        "9 And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.",
        "10 Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?",
        "11 Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.",
        "12 And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.",
        "13 Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.",
        "14 And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.",
        "15 But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.",
        "16 Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him forth.",
        "17 And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.",
        "18 Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.",
        "19 And Pilate wrote a title also, and he put it upon the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
        "20 This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.",
        "21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the Jews.",
        "22 Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.",
        "23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.",
        "24 They said then one to another: Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast lots. And the soldiers indeed did these things.",
        "25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.",
        "26 When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son.",
        "27 After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.",
        "28 Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.",
        "29 Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his mouth.",
        "30 Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.",
        "31 Then the Jews, (because it was the parasceve,) that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that was a great sabbath day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.",
        "32 The soldiers therefore came; and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.",
        "33 But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.",
        "34 But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.",
        "35 And he that saw it, hath given testimony, and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true; that you also may believe.",
        "36 For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.",
        "37 And again another scripture saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced.",
        "38 And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.",
        "39 And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the first came to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.",
        "40 They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.",
        "41 Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid.",
        "42 There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand."

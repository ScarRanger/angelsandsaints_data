        "34 But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, respected by all the people, commanded the men to be put forth a little while.",
        "35 And he said to them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do, as touching these men.",
        "36 For before these days rose up Theodas, affirming himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all that believed him were scattered, and brought to nothing.",
        "37 After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling, and drew away the people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as consented to him, were dispersed.",
        "38 And now, therefore, I say to you, refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this council or this work be of men, it will come to nought;",
        "39 But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God. And they consented to him.",
        "40 And calling in the apostles, after they had scourged them, they charged them that they should not speak at all in the name of Jesus; and they dismissed them.",
        "41 And they indeed went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus.",
        "42 And every day they ceased not in the temple, and from house to house, to teach and preach Christ Jesus."

        "11 And Jesus took the loaves: and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.",
        "12 And when they were filled, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.",
        "13 They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.",
        "14 Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet, that is to come into the world.",
        "15 Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to take him by force, and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone."

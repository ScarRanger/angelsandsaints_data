        "28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after them, neither did there so much as one of them remain.",
        "29 But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and on the left:",
        "30 And the Lord delivered Israel on that day out of the hands of the Egyptians.",
        "31 And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand that the Lord had used against them: and the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses his servant.",
        "15:1 Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this canticle to the Lord: and said: Let us sing to the Lord: for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and the rider he hath thrown into the sea.",

        "7 For a, small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee.",
        "8 In a moment of indignation have I hid my face a little while from thee, but with everlasting kindness have I had mercy on thee, said the Lord thy Redeemer.",
        "9 This thing is to me as in the days of Noe, to whom I swore, that I would no more bring in the waters of Noe upon the earth: so have I sworn not to be angry with thee, and not to rebuke thee.",
        "10 For the mountains shall be moved, and the hills shall tremble; but my mercy shall not depart from thee, and the covenant of my peace shall not be moved: said the Lord that hath mercy on thee.",
        "11 O poor little one, tossed with tempest, without all comfort, behold I will lay thy stones in order, and will lay thy foundations with sapphires,",
        "12 And I will make thy bulwarks of jasper: and thy gates of graven stones, and all thy borders of desirable stones.",
        "13 All thy children shall be taught of the Lord: and great shall be the peace of thy children.",
        "14 And thou shalt be founded in justice: depart far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.",
        "1 All you that thirst, come to the waters: and you that have no money make haste, buy, and eat: come ye, buy wine and milk without money, and without any price.",
        "2 Why do you spend money for that which is not breed, and your labour for that which doth not satisfy you? Hearken diligently to me, and eat that which is good, and your soul shall be delighted in fatness.",
        "3 Incline your ear and come to me: hear and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the faithful mercies of David.",
        "4 Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, for a leader and a master to the Gentiles.",
        "5 Behold thou shalt call a nation, which thou knewest not: and the nations that knew not thee shall run to thee, because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.",
        "6 Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found: call upon him, while he is near.",
        "7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unjust man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God: for he is bountiful to forgive.",
        "8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts: nor your ways my ways, saith the Lord.",
        "9 For as the heavens are exalted above the earth, so are my ways exalted above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts.",
        "10 And as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and return no more thither, but soak the earth, and water it, and make it to spring, and give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:",
        "11 So shall my word be, which shall go forth from my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall do whatsoever I please, and shall prosper in the things for which I sent it.",
        "9 Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life: give ear, that thou mayst learn wisdom.",
        "10 How happeneth it, O Israel, that thou art in thy enemies’ land?",
        "11 Thou art grown old in a strange country, thou art defiled with the dead: thou art counted with them that go down into hell.",
        "12 Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom:",
        "13 For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou hadst surely dwelt in peace for ever.",
        "14 Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding: that thou mayst know also where is length of days and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.",
        "15 Who hath found out her place? and who hath gone in to her treasures?",
        "32 But he that knoweth all things, knoweth her, and hath found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore, and filled it with cattle and fourfooted beasts:",
        "33 He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth: and hath called it, and it obeyeth him with trembling.",
        "34 And the stars have given light in their watches, and rejoiced:",
        "35 They were called, and they said: Here we are: and with cheerfulness they have shined forth to him that made them.",
        "36 This is our God, and there shall no other be accounted of in comparison of him.",
        "37 He found out all the way of knowledge, and gave it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.",
        "38 Afterwards he was seen upon earth, and conversed with men.",
        "4:1 This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law, that is for ever: all they that keep it, shall come to life: but they that have forsaken it, to death.",
        "2 Return, O Jacob, and take hold of it, walk in the way by its brightness, in the presence of the light thereof.",
        "3 Give not thy honour to another, nor thy dignity to a strange nation.",
        "4 We are happy, O Israel: because the things that are pleasing to God, are made known to us.",
        "16 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:",
        "17a Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it with their ways, and with their doings.",
        "18 And I poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and with their idols they defiled it.",
        "19 And I scattered them among the nations, and they are dispersed through the countries: I have judged them according to their ways, and their devices.",
        "20 And when they entered among the nations whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when it was said of them: This is the people of the Lord, and they are come forth out of his land.",
        "21 And I have regarded my own holy name, which the house of Israel hath profaned among the nations to which they went in.",
        "22 Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: It is not for your sake that I will do this, O house of Israel, but for my holy name’s sake, which you have profaned among the nations whither you went.",
        "23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which you have profaned in the midst of them: that the Gentiles may know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord of hosts, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.",
        "24 For I will take you from among the Gentiles, and will gather you together out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.",
        "25 And I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and I will cleanse you from all your idols.",
        "26 And I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh.",
        "27 And I will put my spirit in the midst of you: and I will cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my judgments, and do them.",
        "28 And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.",
        "3 Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?",
        "4 For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.",
        "5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.",
        "6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.",
        "7 For he that is dead is justified from sin.",
        "8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:",
        "9 Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.",
        "10 For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:",
        "11 So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord."

        "6 For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?",
        "7 For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.",
        "8 But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time,",
        "9 Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.",

        "11 As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.",

        "13 And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them: Trade till I come.",
        "14 But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.",
        "15 And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.",
        "16 And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.",
        "17 And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.",
        "18 And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.",
        "19 And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities.",
        "20 And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin;",
        "21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.",
        "22 He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow:",
        "23 And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?",
        "24 And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.",
        "25 And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.",
        "26 But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him.",
        "27 But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me.",
        "28 And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem."

        "24 Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.",
        "25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:",
        "26 That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:",
        "27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.",
        "28 So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.",
        "29 For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:",
        "30 Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.",
        "31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.",
        "32 This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.",
        "33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband."

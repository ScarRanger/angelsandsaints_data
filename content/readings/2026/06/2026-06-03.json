        "23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.",
        "24 And Jesus answering, saith to them: Do ye not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?",
        "25 For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven.",
        "26 And as concerning the dead that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?",

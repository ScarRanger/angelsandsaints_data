        "30 And if the grass of the field, which is today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, God doth so clothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith?",
        "31 Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What shall we eat: or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?",
        "32 For after all these things do the heathens seek. For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things.",
        "33 Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.",
        "34 Be not therefore solicitous for tomorrow; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof."

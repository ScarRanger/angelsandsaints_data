        "21 But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die.",
        "22 I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live.",
        "23 Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways, and live?",
        "24 But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die.",
        "25 And you have said: The way of the Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O house of Israel: Is it my way that is not right, and are not rather your ways perverse?",
        "26 For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therein: in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die.",
        "27 And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive.",
        "28 Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die."

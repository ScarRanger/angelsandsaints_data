        "12 Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
        "13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.",
        "14 And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.",
        "15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.",
        "16 For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.",
        "17 And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.",

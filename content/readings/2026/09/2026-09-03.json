        "1 And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth,",

        "3 And going into one of the ships that was Simon’s, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship.",
        "4 Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.",
        "5 And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have labored all the night, and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.",
        "6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes, and their net broke.",
        "7 And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking.",
        "8 Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.",
        "9 For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.",
        "10 And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.",
        "11 And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him."

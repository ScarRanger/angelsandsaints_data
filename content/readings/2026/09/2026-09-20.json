        "3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place idle.",
        "4 And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.",
        "5 And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.",
        "6 But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?",
        "7 They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.",
        "8 And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.",
        "9 When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.",
        "10 But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.",

        "13 But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?",
        "14 Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.",
        "15 Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?",
        "16a So shall the last be first, and the first last."

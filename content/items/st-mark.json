When we read Mark's gospel, we can hear St. Peter speaking through Mark's words. St. Mark wrote his Gospel in Greek, sometime between A.D. 50-70. Most scholars believe Mark's Gospel was the first Gospel account written and that both Matthew and Luke used Mark's Gospel in the writing of their own Gospel accounts."

Later, inspired by the martyrdom of Franciscan missionaries in Morocco, Fernando joined the Franciscan Order and took the name Anthony. He set out to preach in Morocco but fell ill and had to return. On the return journey, his ship was blown off course and landed in Sicily, leading Anthony to Italy, where his true mission would unfold."

He is the patron saint of lost items because of the story of a young novice who stole his book of psalms. Anthony prayed, and the thief was moved to return the book. Since then, countless people have prayed to St. Anthony to help find lost items."

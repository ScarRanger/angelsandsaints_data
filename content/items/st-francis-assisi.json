      "value": "St. Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 or 1182 in Assisi, Italy, to a wealthy merchant family. As a young man, Francis lived a carefree life, enjoying parties and dreaming of becoming a knight. In 1202, he was captured in a war between Assisi and Perugia and spent a year in prison. After his release, he became seriously ill. During his illness and recovery, Francis began to experience a profound spiritual conversion."

      "value": "While praying in the dilapidated church of San Damiano, Francis heard Jesus speak to him from the crucifix: \"Francis, go and repair my house, which as you see is falling into ruin.\" Francis initially understood this literally and began to repair several small churches. Later, he realized that God was calling him to renew the entire Church."

      "value": "Francis renounced his wealth and inheritance, even stripping off his fine clothes in the public square and returning them to his father. He put on a rough tunic and began to live a life of radical poverty, preaching repentance and living the Gospel in its purest form. He embraced \"Lady Poverty\" as his bride and saw poverty as the way to perfect union with Christ."

In 1209, he wrote a simple Rule of life for his brothers, which was approved by Pope Innocent III. This marked the founding of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans). Later, with St. Clare, he founded the Poor Clares for women, and he also established the Third Order for laypeople."

Francis emphasized poverty, humility, obedience, and love for all of God's creation. He had a special love for nature and called all creatures his brothers and sisters, most famously shown in his \"Canticle of the Creatures.\""

He was the first recorded person in history to receive the stigmata. Francis bore these wounds for the rest of his life, though he tried to hide them out of humility. The wounds caused him great pain, yet he rejoiced in sharing in Christ's suffering."

Although the Sultan did not convert, he was deeply impressed by Francis's faith and courage and allowed him to return safely. This encounter demonstrated Francis's commitment to peace and evangelization through love rather than violence."

The government had outlawed public worship and was executing priests and lay Catholics who refused to renounce their faith. This conflict, known as the Cristero War, saw many martyrs for the faith."

They cut the soles of his feet and made him walk through the town to the cemetery where he would be executed. With each painful step, José cried out \"Viva Cristo Rey!\" (Long live Christ the King!). Before he was shot, he drew a cross on the ground, knelt, and forgave his executioners. He was 14 years old. José Luis was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and canonized by Pope Francis in 2016."

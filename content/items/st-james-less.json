St. Paul tells us (Galatians 1:19) that James was one of the pillars of the Church. According to the tradition of the early Church, St. James was the first bishop of Jerusalem and presided over the first Church council."

Standing high upon the Temple, James loudly preached the faith in Jesus and when he was finished the angry mob threw him off the Temple. The fall did not kill him so they stoned him. Finally, a fuller (one who thickens cloth by moistening, heating and pressing) took the club used to beat garments and gave James a fatal blow to the head."

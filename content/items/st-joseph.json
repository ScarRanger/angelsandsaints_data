He protected and provided for the Holy Family, taking them to Egypt to escape Herod's massacre of the innocents."

He is also the patron of workers, fathers, families, and a happy death (since tradition holds that he died in the arms of Jesus and Mary). Though little is recorded about Joseph in Scripture, his faithful obedience and loving protection of Jesus and Mary make him one of the greatest saints. Pope Francis has a special devotion to St. Joseph and declared a Year of St. Joseph in 2021."

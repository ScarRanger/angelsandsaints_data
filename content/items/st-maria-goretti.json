At the age of 11, Maria was attacked by a young man named Alessandro Serenelli, who tried to rape her. Maria resisted, saying \"No! It is a sin! God does not want it!\" Alessandro stabbed her repeatedly."

After his release, he sought out Maria's mother and begged her forgiveness, which she gave. Alessandro attended Maria's canonization in 1950. St. Maria Goretti is the patron saint of youth, victims of rape, and purity."
